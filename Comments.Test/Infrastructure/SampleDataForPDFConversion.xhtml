			<h2 class="title">Your responsibility</h2>
			<p>The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.</p>
			<p>Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.</p>
			<p>
				Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/sustainability">assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations</a> wherever possible.

The recommendations are labelled according to when they were originally published (see <a class="link" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg164/chapter/about-this-guideline" data-original-url="http://publications.nice.org.uk/familial-breast-cancer-cg164/about-this-guideline">About this guideline</a> for details).</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a id="Text2"></a>Familial breast cancer typically occurs in people with an unusually high number of family members affected by breast, ovarian or a related cancer. If more cases of breast, ovarian or a related cancer are seen in a family than would be expected by chance alone, this can be a sign that genes have caused or contributed to its development. Breast cancer in people who have a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer may need different management from that in people without a family history of these cancers. This is because of differences in the future risk of developing contralateral breast cancer.</p><p>The risk of developing breast cancer depends on the:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>nature of the family history</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>number of relatives who have developed breast, ovarian or a related cancer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>age at which relatives developed breast cancer </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>age of the person. </p></li></ul><p>This guideline describes the classification and care of people at risk of familial breast cancer. It updates and replaces recommendations in NICE clinical guideline 41 on genetic testing thresholds, surveillance and risk reduction and treatment strategies for people without breast cancer who are at increased risk because of a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer.</p><p>This guideline also covers people with a diagnosis of breast cancer and a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer. It makes new recommendations on genetic testing thresholds, surveillance and risk reduction and treatment strategies.

The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's <a class="link" href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/14316.asp">Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices</a> for further information.

The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.</p><div class="section" title="2.1 Carrier probability calculation models"><h3 class="title"><a id="carrier-probability-calculation-models"></a>2.1 Carrier probability calculation models</h3><p>Further research is recommended into developing and validating models for calculating carrier probability, which incorporate additional data, such as the molecular pathology of tumours and the prevalence of mutations in different ethnic groups. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>This guideline recommends offering genetic testing to people with a 10% likelihood of carrying a <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation. Models to assess the likelihood of a <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation need to be improved because their estimates still have wide confidence margins. Models are sensitive to population prevalence of mutations and need adjustment for pathological subtypes of breast and ovarian cancer, which are particularly associated with <em>BRCA1</em> mutations. Improving the predictive powers of these models will provide more cost-effective testing.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.2 Rapid genetic testing"><h3 class="title"><a id="rapid-genetic-testing"></a>2.2 Rapid genetic testing</h3><p>Research is recommended to determine the benefits and harms of creating rapid access to genetic testing for people with newly diagnosed breast cancer. This research should address the optimum model for service delivery and organisation, the clinical and cost effectiveness of such a change, uptake outcomes and patients' experience. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>There is no clear evidence base for rapid genetic testing at the time of diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Knowledge of genetic status may increase uptake of risk-reducing mastectomy and in future guide first-line chemotherapy. To be useful for such decision-making, results of genetic tests are needed within 4 weeks of diagnosis. This creates logistic problems in providing enough information for considered decision-making and delivering results of genetic tests in a supportive environment. Some GDG members were of the opinion that people had enough to cope with shortly after diagnosis without additional worries about genetic testing. However, others thought that early knowledge of genetic status would help decisions about surgery thus avoiding the need to consider this at a future date. For example, initial treatment by wide local excision often necessitates radiotherapy, which makes an acceptable cosmetic operation more challenging. Genetic counselling to facilitate such decisions soon after diagnosis would require reorganisation of current services. </p></div><div class="section" title="2.3 Benefits of MRI surveillance in women over 50 years"><h3 class="title"><a id="benefits-of-mri-surveillance-in-women-over-50-years"></a>2.3 Benefits of MRI surveillance in women over 50 years</h3><p>Research is recommended to establish the risk and benefits of MRI surveillance compared with mammography in women over 50 years with a personal history of breast cancer. Studies should include sub-analysis for breast density. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>There have been at least 6 large trials of MRI surveillance in women at high risk of breast cancer. However, none of these contained enough women to assess the potential benefit of MRI over mammography alone in women over 50 years. After 50 years of age, mammography becomes more sensitive and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity may make MRI less cost effective. Although breast density decreases with age, and particularly after the menopause, there is no sudden change at any particular age. For this reason breast density should be included as a confounding variable.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.4 Chemoprevention to reduce incidence of breast cancer"><h3 class="title"><a id="chemoprevention-to-reduce-incidence-of-breast-cancer"></a>2.4 Chemoprevention to reduce incidence of breast cancer</h3><p>A randomised controlled trial is recommended to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen for reducing the incidence of breast cancer in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>This guideline recommends offering raloxifene or tamoxifen to women at high risk of developing breast cancer and considering such treatments as chemoprevention for women at moderate risk. One randomised study in North America showed an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) to be effective for the primary prevention of breast cancer. However, there has been no randomised control trial comparing aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen or raloxifene (selective oestrogen receptor modulators or SERMs). Such a trial could better inform women of the best available approach for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.5 Impact of risk-reducing surgery"><h3 class="title"><a id="impact-of-risk-reducing-surgery"></a>2.5 Impact of risk-reducing surgery</h3><p>Further research is recommended to compare psychosocial and clinical outcomes in women who choose and women who do not choose to have risk-reducing surgery. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>Many women are happy with their decision to undergo risk-reducing surgery. However, some women do subsequently regret this choice. A greater understanding of the factors that predict satisfaction or regret will help to guide women's choices in the future. Studies show that risk-reducing surgery significantly reduces risk of breast cancer, but there is insufficient evidence to decide between, for example, skin-sparing mastectomy and total mastectomy. The pros and cons of risk-reducing surgery in women with a diagnosis of cancer also need further study.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" title="3 Other information"><h2 class="title"><a id="other-information"></a>3 Other information</h2><div class="section" title="3.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed"><h3 class="title"><a id="scope-and-how-this-guideline-was-developed"></a>3.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed</h3><p>NICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a <a class="link" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/proxy/?sourceUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nice.org.uk%2fguidance%2findex.jsp%3faction%3ddownload%26amp%3bo%3d55250" data-original-url="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=download&amp;o=55250">scope</a> that defines what the guideline will and will not cover.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><strong>How this guideline was developed</strong></p><p>NICE commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer to develop this guideline.

The Guideline Development Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p><p>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also <a class="link" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg164/chapter/patient-centred-care" data-original-url="http://publications.nice.org.uk/familial-breast-cancer-cg164/patient-centred-care">Patient-centred care</a>). </p><div class="section" title="Interventions that must (or must not) be used"><h4 class="title"><a id="interventions-that-must-or-must-not-be-used"></a>Interventions that must (or must not) be used</h4><p>We usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation.

We use similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer…') when we are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p></div><div class="section" title="Interventions that could be used"><h4 class="title"><a id="interventions-that-could-be-used"></a>Interventions that could be used</h4><p>We use 'consider' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div><div class="section" title="Recommendation wording in guideline updates"><h4 class="title"><a id="recommendation-wording-in-guideline-updates"></a>Recommendation wording in guideline updates</h4><p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see 'Update information' above for details about how recommendations are labelled).

				<p>The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.</p>
				<p>Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.</p>
				<p>
					Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/who-we-are/sustainability">assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations</a> wherever possible.

If more cases of breast, ovarian or a related cancer are seen in a family than would be expected by chance alone, this can be a sign that genes have caused or contributed to its development. Breast cancer in people who have a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer may need different management from that in people without a family history of these cancers. This is because of differences in the future risk of developing contralateral breast cancer.</p><p>The risk of developing breast cancer depends on the:</p><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>nature of the family history</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>number of relatives who have developed breast, ovarian or a related cancer</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>age at which relatives developed breast cancer </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>age of the person. </p></li></ul><p>This guideline describes the classification and care of people at risk of familial breast cancer. It updates and replaces recommendations in NICE clinical guideline 41 on genetic testing thresholds, surveillance and risk reduction and treatment strategies for people without breast cancer who are at increased risk because of a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer.</p><p>This guideline also covers people with a diagnosis of breast cancer and a family history of breast, ovarian or a related cancer.

The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.</p><div class="section" title="2.1 Carrier probability calculation models"><h3 class="title"><a id="carrier-probability-calculation-models"></a>2.1 Carrier probability calculation models</h3><p>Further research is recommended into developing and validating models for calculating carrier probability, which incorporate additional data, such as the molecular pathology of tumours and the prevalence of mutations in different ethnic groups. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>This guideline recommends offering genetic testing to people with a 10% likelihood of carrying a <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation. Models to assess the likelihood of a <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation need to be improved because their estimates still have wide confidence margins. Models are sensitive to population prevalence of mutations and need adjustment for pathological subtypes of breast and ovarian cancer, which are particularly associated with <em>BRCA1</em> mutations. Improving the predictive powers of these models will provide more cost-effective testing.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.2 Rapid genetic testing"><h3 class="title"><a id="rapid-genetic-testing"></a>2.2 Rapid genetic testing</h3><p>Research is recommended to determine the benefits and harms of creating rapid access to genetic testing for people with newly diagnosed breast cancer. This research should address the optimum model for service delivery and organisation, the clinical and cost effectiveness of such a change, uptake outcomes and patients' experience. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>There is no clear evidence base for rapid genetic testing at the time of diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Knowledge of genetic status may increase uptake of risk-reducing mastectomy and in future guide first-line chemotherapy. To be useful for such decision-making, results of genetic tests are needed within 4 weeks of diagnosis. This creates logistic problems in providing enough information for considered decision-making and delivering results of genetic tests in a supportive environment. Some GDG members were of the opinion that people had enough to cope with shortly after diagnosis without additional worries about genetic testing. However, others thought that early knowledge of genetic status would help decisions about surgery thus avoiding the need to consider this at a future date. For example, initial treatment by wide local excision often necessitates radiotherapy, which makes an acceptable cosmetic operation more challenging. Genetic counselling to facilitate such decisions soon after diagnosis would require reorganisation of current services. </p></div><div class="section" title="2.3 Benefits of MRI surveillance in women over 50 years"><h3 class="title"><a id="benefits-of-mri-surveillance-in-women-over-50-years"></a>2.3 Benefits of MRI surveillance in women over 50 years</h3><p>Research is recommended to establish the risk and benefits of MRI surveillance compared with mammography in women over 50 years with a personal history of breast cancer. Studies should include sub-analysis for breast density. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>There have been at least 6 large trials of MRI surveillance in women at high risk of breast cancer. However, none of these contained enough women to assess the potential benefit of MRI over mammography alone in women over 50 years. After 50 years of age, mammography becomes more sensitive and the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity may make MRI less cost effective. Although breast density decreases with age, and particularly after the menopause, there is no sudden change at any particular age. For this reason breast density should be included as a confounding variable.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.4 Chemoprevention to reduce incidence of breast cancer"><h3 class="title"><a id="chemoprevention-to-reduce-incidence-of-breast-cancer"></a>2.4 Chemoprevention to reduce incidence of breast cancer</h3><p>A randomised controlled trial is recommended to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen for reducing the incidence of breast cancer in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>This guideline recommends offering raloxifene or tamoxifen to women at high risk of developing breast cancer and considering such treatments as chemoprevention for women at moderate risk. One randomised study in North America showed an aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) to be effective for the primary prevention of breast cancer. However, there has been no randomised control trial comparing aromatase inhibitors with tamoxifen or raloxifene (selective oestrogen receptor modulators or SERMs). Such a trial could better inform women of the best available approach for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.</p></div><div class="section" title="2.5 Impact of risk-reducing surgery"><h3 class="title"><a id="impact-of-risk-reducing-surgery"></a>2.5 Impact of risk-reducing surgery</h3><p>Further research is recommended to compare psychosocial and clinical outcomes in women who choose and women who do not choose to have risk-reducing surgery. <strong>[new 2013]</strong></p><p><strong>Why this is important</strong></p><p>Many women are happy with their decision to undergo risk-reducing surgery. However, some women do subsequently regret this choice. A greater understanding of the factors that predict satisfaction or regret will help to guide women's choices in the future. Studies show that risk-reducing surgery significantly reduces risk of breast cancer, but there is insufficient evidence to decide between, for example, skin-sparing mastectomy and total mastectomy. The pros and cons of risk-reducing surgery in women with a diagnosis of cancer also need further study.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" title="3 Other information"><h2 class="title"><a id="other-information"></a>3 Other information</h2><div class="section" title="3.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed"><h3 class="title"><a id="scope-and-how-this-guideline-was-developed"></a>3.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed</h3><p>NICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a <a class="link" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/proxy/?sourceUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nice.org.uk%2fguidance%2findex.jsp%3faction%3ddownload%26amp%3bo%3d55250" data-original-url="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=download&amp;o=55250">scope</a> that defines what the guideline will and will not cover.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><strong>How this guideline was developed</strong></p><p>NICE commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer to develop this guideline.

The Guideline Development Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).</p><p>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also <a class="link" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg164/chapter/patient-centred-care" data-original-url="http://publications.nice.org.uk/familial-breast-cancer-cg164/patient-centred-care">Patient-centred care</a>). </p><div class="section" title="Interventions that must (or must not) be used"><h4 class="title"><a id="interventions-that-must-or-must-not-be-used"></a>Interventions that must (or must not) be used</h4><p>We usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation.

We use similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer…') when we are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.</p></div><div class="section" title="Interventions that could be used"><h4 class="title"><a id="interventions-that-could-be-used"></a>Interventions that could be used</h4><p>We use 'consider' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.</p></div><div class="section" title="Recommendation wording in guideline updates"><h4 class="title"><a id="recommendation-wording-in-guideline-updates"></a>Recommendation wording in guideline updates</h4><p>NICE began using this approach to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after publication of the 2009 version of 'The guidelines manual' (January 2009). This does not apply to any recommendations ending <strong>[2004]</strong> (see 'Update information' above for details about how recommendations are labelled).
