# Front End Readme

### Modernizr

`npm run modernizr` will build a file `modernizr-custom.js` into the `public/vendor` folder, based on the settings in `modernizr-config.json` in the root of `ClientApp`.

The resultant file `public/vendor/modernizr-custom.js` is excluded from version control and is generated at each `npm start` or `npm run build`.
